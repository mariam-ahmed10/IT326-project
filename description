# IT326-project

Project Description: This project aims to evaluate students' performance in Mathematics, English, and Brazilian using data mining techniques on the "Students Exam Scores" dataset from Kaggle.
We will apply classification algorithms to categorize students into high, medium, or low performance levels and use K-means clustering to group students based on performance and personal attributes.
The goal is to identify key factors affecting academic success and offer recommendations to enhance student outcomes
