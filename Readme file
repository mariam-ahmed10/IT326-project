Motivation and Goal : The purpose of this dataset is to use data mining algorithms such as classification and clustering to evaluate and understand the elements that influence students' test performance. We will apply classification algorithms to categorize students into high, medium, or low performance levels and use K-means clustering to group students based on performance and personal attributes.
